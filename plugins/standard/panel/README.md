# Panel

This plugin implements a panel in discord to control your servers.

## Requirements
**Your servers must be running using [litehost](https://github.com/iDarkLightning/LiteHost)** in order to use this plugin.
Once you have LiteHost running, you can control your servers directly from discord, no other configuration needed!
