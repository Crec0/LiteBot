A good amount of this code is sourced from mcstatus by dinnerbone.
I decided to use his code as it basically handles socket connections,
and simple usage of minecraft's query protocol and his code implements
it quite well. Some bits of it have of course been modified in order
to better suit my needs. I did not simply install and use his library
as I only required a small portion of its features. I also did modify
parts of it, which I wouldn't have been able to do otheriwse.

His code can be found here: https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus
